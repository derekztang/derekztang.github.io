      <p ng-show="home.tab === 0" class="hide">Welcome web traveller! You've found my "ground zero" for the web technologies I fool around with. So far it's made of just HTML/CSS.

      <p ng-show="home.tab === 1" class="hide">I've added responsive design! In order to make it look nice on all screens, I've utilized media query in my CSS. It now reacts to the width of the page. You can resize the browser window to see what it'll look like. Check out what the nav bar does when squeezed under 500px!</p>
