      I think peer pairing is a great way to solve challenges. I always find it rewarding to see a different approach to solving the same problem by having another person explain how they came up with a solution.Coding can often times be stressful and frustrating when errors occur. Having another person's input helps with learning new skills and tricks.

      With that being said, there are definitely times when peer pairing can be difficult. Most of the feedback I've received so far has been positive. I have had a few lengthy pairing sessions, but all of the feedback has been kind. The feedback is useful because they point out where I can improve. Based on the feedback, I think I can look at the material before a pairing session. I should also remember to switch driver/navigator roles. Writing feedback has generally been helpful for me.
