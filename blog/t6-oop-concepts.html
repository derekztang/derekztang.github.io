   Class methods are methods that are called on a class and instance methods are methods that are called on an instance of a class.
  </p>

  <p>
   Ruby is very flexible and as such it allows several ways to define a class method. The following is a sample of the most commonly used ways.

    # Way 1
     class Foo
        def self.bar
          puts 'class method'
        end
     end
  </p>

  <p>
   The key difference between class methods and instance methods is instance methods only work with an instance and thus you have to create a new instance to use them
