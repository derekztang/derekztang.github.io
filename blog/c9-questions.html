      What exactly makes a good question? I like to ask questions whenever I am confused. My questions build from one to the other until I can grasp whatever concept I didn't understand. After researching what makes a good question, I believe it's important to be able to ask revelant question in a concise format. The construction of it must be specific and efficient.

      The best take-away from the readings is ultimately to think in terms of the reader. It's important to put yourself in the shoes of listener who is looking to answer your question. If the quesitons is concise, to the point and has examples of the code being questioned, it should give the people who answer it enough information to figure out what needs to be done to get it working. After reviewing one of my questions to my accountability group, I can safely say... my quesitons are relevant and concise enough.
