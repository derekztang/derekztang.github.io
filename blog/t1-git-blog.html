      My cat and I usually get along fabulously. But when it gets cold and Samson spots the alluring warmth of my laptop, he will gracefully disregard the possibility that I may be writing an important essay and plop down on my keyboard. On one occasion, by a grand convergence of unlikely keystroke combinations, he selected the whole masterpiece, replaced it with the letters "fdvfxv," and saved the document. My seven hour investment was sorely lost. <strong>How could I have prevented this?</strong>

      Other than casting Samson into oblivion, I could have used <em>version control software</em>. Git is an example of this. It remembers every saved, i.e. "committed," version of a file, allowing the user to return to a previously saved iteration of the file in case something goes awry. Hence, I would've been able to recover my 2000 word essay as it was before being replaced by my cat's nonsense. It has other uses as well, such as allowing the user to create multiple divergent branches of their project. The various branches can be synthesized together into a code-frankenstein. This can be useful for tinkering with certain features in isolation.

      <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> is another tool that has captivated the hearts of programmers. It's a website, so putting your files there means they're backed up in case something happens to the local version. If your laptop is stolen, your files are safely stored online! Github also allows you to share your code with the world â€“ or only a few people if that's what you desire. Multiple people can clone collections of files (repositories), make changes, and add their changes concurrently! The changes can be seemlessly merged together without overwriting anyone's hard work. It makes programming a much more collaborative endeavor. It can also serve as a portfolio, showcasing one's achievements and contributions. In fact, much of the documentation for languages, frameworks, and plugins are disseminated using github, e.g. AngularJS. Overall, it's like LinkedIn for programmers!
