    <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>

      Recursion is a personal fascination. It's a programming paradigm hailed by many as an elegant approach to solve problems. To approach a problem via recursion is to break that problem into a sequence of increasingly <em>smaller instances</em> of the same problem. To be more concrete, a recursive function is one that <strong>calls itself</strong>, thereby repeating sequentially and reducing the problem each time. Like looping, it entails the repeated execution of a portion of code. However, it differs in that each recursion reduces the complexity of the problem, whittling it down to its solution. For example, let's use this strategy to write a Ruby method that does basic exponentiation.

      This method first checks if the exponent is 0. If so, it returns 1. This is known as the <em>base case</em>. It's where the repetition ends. It then multiplies the base by the output of, well, itself with the exponent decremented by one. The method will get repeated until the exponent eventually homes in on 1, stopping the repetition. In other words, the solution to 2<sup>4</sup> is trimmed down to 2<sup>3</sup> which is trimmed to 2<sup>2</sup> and so on.

      This program can also be written by using a simple loop or a <code>#times</code> method. In fact, doing so would produce a program that executes roughly 10 times faster. Writing a recursive function can sometimes come at a performance cost. In some contexts, this is compensated for by a dramatic improvement in the readability of the code. Let's look at an example that is drastically simplified by using recursion: finding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant of a matrix</a>.

      The determinant is a useful number associated with a square matrix in linear algebra. For this method we'll use the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DeterminantExpansionbyMinors.html">method of minors</a>. The input for the method will be a 2D array, each inner array representing one row of the matrix from top to bottom.

    <p>
      In a manner analogous to the exponent method, it first checks if the matrix is 2x2. If it is, the simple cross multiplication algorithm is used. Otherwise, the <code>make_minor</code> method is used to map each of the minors to a new array with the appropriate coefficients. These terms are then added using <code>#inject</code> to arrive at the determinant! As we can see, the recurring problem is the determinant of each minor. The size of the minors decreases by once each time, eventually converging to 2, where the repetition terminates. This method is nice because it works for any size of square matrix!

      Hopefully I've convinced you of the elegance and simplicity endowed on a program with a judicious use of recursion. Using a loop would make the <code>matrix_determ</code> method far more complicated. Although it's an expensive approach, it may be worth it to refine your code.
