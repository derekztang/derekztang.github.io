      I'm now reaching the last week of prep-work in Dev Bootcamp and I've gone through the basics fundamentals of Ruby, Javascript, and some SQL. As I continue to do Ruby exercises, I realized that I have gone a long way from week 1 of DBC. It's a great feeling to look back and see all my accomplishments that I've made with each week's exercises. Along this 9 weeks journey, I've met many people like me, who are all looking to become developers.

      A question that's always been picking at my mind is "What exactly does Rails have to do with Ruby?" and it's a question that I've never actually explored before. This blog post is going to be centered around that topic so we can get a basic understanding of what we'll be diving into in the next few weeks.

      So what exactly is "Ruby on Rails"? To answer this question, we need to first address what "Ruby" is. Ruby is an object-orientated programming language that allows users to create code simply and productively. There are not as many syntax restrictions as other languages with Ruby. It is a language that is general-purposed but more often used for web development.

      Now, what is Rails? Rails is a software library that works as an extension to the Ruby language. It is a framework for building websites and Rails allows for it to become complex websites. Rails combines Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create web applications on a web server. Ruby on Rails is considered back-end development because of this. Rails compiles all different libraries that can make building websites much easier. It has picked up popularity within startups because of this quickness that websites can be build by using Ruby on Rails.

      That's my breakdown of Ruby on Rails! On it's most simpliest terms, it's a Rails framework that is based upon Ruby.
