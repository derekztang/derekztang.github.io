      "Ogres are like onions!" exclaims beloved Dreamworks star, Shrek. I think it's a metaphor for his righteous, sentimental heart beneath his monstrous exterior. But if we take it literally, then Shrek has something in common with HTML elements! From innermost to outermost, the layers of HTML elements are content, padding, border, and margins.

      The content is, well, the <em>stuff</em>. If the element is a <code>&ltp&gt</code> then the content is the text. For a <code>&ltimg&gt</code>, it's the image itself. Outside of this is the padding. The padding, set with the <code>padding</code> CSS property, both pushes away the border and extends the background color. The border is exactly what you think it is: a set of lines that surround the content and its padding. It can be specified by a thickness, color, and pattern using the <code>border</code> property. You can even round the corners with the <code>border-radius</code> property!

      Here we can see an <strong>absolutely beautiful</strong> implementation of these layers. Without the padding, everything would be very cramped. It looks much more aesthetically delightful with 20px of spacing. The border gives it an orderly look. Finally the margin keeps the sidebar a comfortable distance away. If you want to get a firm grasp on the effects of padding and margins, try opening the Chrome Developer Tools and un-checking the box next to these properties for a selected HTML element. It'll manifest that change in the browser in real time!
