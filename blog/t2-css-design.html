      What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?
    </p>
    <p>
      inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML next to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), it behaves as a block element.
    </p>
