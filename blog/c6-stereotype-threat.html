    <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <h3>The Perils of Negative Stereotypes</h3>
    <h4><em>Mar 13, 2015</em></h4>
    <p>
      In a <a ui-sref="c4-tech-issues">previous post</a>, I discussed an un-addressed crisis in ethnic and gender diversity in the tech industry. A disproportionately low percentage of women and racial minorities seem to be pursuing tech careers. If there is to be a remedy, we must first understand the underpinning causes. Social psychology professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele">Claude M. Steele</a> has spent his career on this exact line of inquiry. In this lecture, he summarizes a theory he calls "Stereotype Threat" which predicates the existence of obstacles due to the circulation of negative stereotypes about an individual's social identity, culminating in <em>achievement gaps</em>.

      The theory states that deleterious effects are experienced when one feels at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Our social identities fall into many categories: age, sex, race, religion, profession, sexual orientation, social class, creed, political persuasion, etc. Most people are affiliated with at least one social identity that is negatively stereotyped. However, the groups facing stereotypes about <strong>intelligence</strong> seem to be most hindered by stereotype threat in the pursuit of tech careers. The predicament is most adverse in academic settings. For example, the performance of African-American students on the SAT reasoning test is encumbered by burdensome anxieties about confirming the stereotype that they are less intelligent. This discrepancy generates obstacles for these students in their academic pursuits. Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson first demonstrated this effect in 1995 by measuring intellectual performance with the Graduate Record Examination test (GRE). Two groups of students, each composed of African-American and European-American students, were administered the <em>same test</em>. However, one group was told to regard the test as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability". To the other group it was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was non-diagnostic of ability". In the first group, the African-American students scored lower on average. But in the other group, the averages were roughly the same.

      The results supported the hypothesis. A test meant to measure intellectual ability exerted a distressing effect on the stereotyped minority. The control group exhibited similar scores between the two groups. As compelling as these results are, the stereotype threat explanation is not without criticism. Not all experiments have successfully reproduced these results, like ones by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440514000831">Flore and Wicherts</a> or by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.370">Fryer, Levitt and List</a>. Some have dismissed this effect as very minor, being highly exaggerated by publication bias.
