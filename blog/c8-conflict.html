         What looks like to be a somewhat straightforward exercise seemed very daunting the more time I think about it. What are the conflicts I run into? I typically can stay relatively calm and away from hot temperment. In the rare case I do get upset, I usually get upset at myself, learn from it, and then just say "move on"
      <p>
        I am a very pratical person and don’t usually let my emotions affect my thought process and decisions. Whenever I do feel my emotions run, though, I usually hold off any decision making until I have a clearer mind. I do this because I don’t want to make the wrong decision at the moment and want time to analyze the possibilities and outcome. When I am faced with a problem, I am usually very direct, which may not always get the right message across. There were times when my teammate felt offended due to my directness and went on the defensive, even if that wasn’t my intention.

        Thinking back, if I had a second chance to go back to the problem and solve it again, I would still use the same approach. It is better to make sure every memeber of the team is on the same page and understands the situation at hand. What I would do differently, though, is to address those problems in a more private manner so no one's feelings gets hurt.
