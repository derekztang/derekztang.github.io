    <h2>Enumerators</h2>
    <h3>The Brains of Iteration</h3>
    <h4><em>Mar 5, 2015</em></h4>
    <p>
      In my <a ui-sref="t4-enumerable-methods">last post</a>, I covered <code>Enumerable</code> methods, the workhorses of iterating in Ruby. The entire repertoire of these iterators is made available to any class by inclusion of the <code>Enumerable</code> module and defining an <code>#each</code> method. An <code>#each</code> is compulsory because iterators rely on it to teach them how to enumerate. In this post, I want to discuss related objects: <strong>enumerators</strong>.

    <h6>A reminder about the <code>#each</code> method.</h6>
    <p>
      Enumerators are instances of the class <code>Enumerator</code>, which includes <code>Enumerable</code>. Think of them as a set of instructions on how to enumerate. However, they differ from <code>#each</code> in that they are <em>not</em> methods. They aren't container objects either, so their is no implicit basis for an <code>#each</code> operation. Rather, the logic for enumeration must be specified in the instantiation of the enumerator. This can be done either by calling <code>Enumerator.new</code> with a code block containing the "each" logic you want it to follow, or by creating it from a container object, e.g. array or range. Shown below is an example of the former.

    <h6>Creating a new instance of <code>Enumerator</code>.</h6>
    <p>
      When <code>#each</code> is called on <code>foo</code>, it will yield 1, then 2, then 3. The parameter <code>y</code> is a <em>yielder</em>, an instance of <code>Enumerator::Yielder</code>, automatically passed to the block. Alternatively, an enumerator can be created from an enumerable object. This is done by calling the each method <em>without giving it a block</em>.

    <h6>Creating an enumerator with <code>Array#each</code>. Enumerators aren't actually displayed this way when printed.</h6>
    <p>
      We're pretty used to giving <code>#each</code> and other <code>Enumerable</code> methods code blocks. But what does calling <code>#each</code> actually <em>return</em> if not given a block? We can see here that it returns an enumerator! It's essentially left as the raw instructions on how to be iterated upon. We can take this enumerator <code>bar</code> and treat it as any other enumerable object as this point. We could call <code>#map</code>, <code>#find</code>, <code>#group_by</code>, etc. This example is a bit trivial. Surely we can use an array or range to enumerate 1, 2, then 3. <strong>So when is this actually useful?</strong> Consider this: What if you wanted to take an array of numbers and multiply every other number by 2, as per the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn Algorithm</a>? What's the most efficient way? I'd like the output to be returned in an array so I can perform more manipulations. Ideally I'd like to <code>#map</code>, but there's an issue.

    <h6>Doubling every other element of the array using a <code>for</code> loop.</h6>
    <p>
      I'll need some way of distinguishing <em>every other</em> element. If I want to use <code>#map</code>, I would need to create another variable to act as a counter upon which I could use <code>% 2</code> to establish the control flow. Either that or I'd have to make an old fashioned <code>for</code> loop. That would let me use the array index as the counter. But isn't there a cleaner way? I know there's an <code>Array#each_with_index</code> method. This method yields two parameters to a block, the array element <em>and</em> its index. Unfortunately there is no <code>Array#map_with_index</code> method. But an enumerator can help us! What if I call the <code>#each_with_index</code> method without a code block? This would produce an enumerator that knows how to enumerate the array elements and the respective index! Then I could call <code>#map</code> on it.

    <h6>Using an enumerator to get the effect of a hypothetical <code>#map_with_index</code>.</h6>
    <p>
      Cheers! We've achieved the desired result more quickly using an enumerator! Using this approach you can also chain any other <code>Enumerable</code> method to gain an index as a parameter. Alternatively, you can use <code>Enumerable#with_index</code>. This method, when called on an enumerator, adds another parameter: the index. So typing <code>arr.map.with_index</code> produces the same net result as <code>arr.each_with_index.map</code>. This expands the possibilites even further. For example, <code>"iterate over us".each_char.with_index</code> has no enumerable counterpart since string are not strictly enumerable.
