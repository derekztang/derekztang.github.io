    <h2>Feminism in Tech</h2>
    <h3>Recruiting Male Allies</h3>
    <h4><em>Apr 12, 2015</em></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>I consider myself a male feminist.</strong> I believe your gender should not rob you of any rights or privileges that you would have if you had been born the opposite gender. Many presume that feminism advocates are mostly female, but I think the involvement of men is important in this plight. I am writing this to articulate my thoughts on how to optimize the discussion of feminism in order to appeal to men and women alike.

      I want to begin by discussing the infamous <a href="http://time.com/79357/not-all-men-a-brief-history-of-every-dudes-favorite-argument/">"not all men"</a> retort. For readers who are unfamiliar, it is an interjection, usually from a male interloper in a discussion of sexism and misogyny, that derails the conversation to a rant about how none of these issues are his fault. It typically begins with a statements such as, "men act like public spaces belong to them," which collectively accuse all men of sexism. Offended at the accusation, he intervenes, contending that <strong><em>not all men</em></strong> do this. Yes, it is a phenomenon common enough to have a name and internet satire!

      I agree with the consensus that these arguments are counterproductive. But I think this phenomenon is indicative of a problem in the way these issues are discussed. Why do these culprits feel so defensive when trying to participate in these discussions? Perhaps the discourse is unwelcoming to prospective male allies. As a man who admittedly used to play the devil's advocate, I want to share my feelings. Perhaps they can elucidate some of the reasons for resistance to the feminism movement. I find educational campaigns to be an indispensable part of activism. This includes internet articles and forums. These contributed to my edification on the subject, and I want the cause to appeal to other men.

      As an undergraduate in college, I became abundantly aware of feminist issues like rape culture, domestic violence, and reproductive rights. They were topics in my GE classes, divisive matters between my friends, and subjects of discussion on the websites I frequented. I sympathized with the movement. Having some personal issues of my own with rigid gender roles, I wanted to learn more. Maybe there was a way I could help. Becoming a part of this community thrilled me, until I read some comments. "Men treat women like..." "Men do this..." "Men do that...". I'm a man. My feelings of dejection toward sexism brought me to this forum. And when I'd arrived, I felt like assumptions were being made about me and how I treat women – <em>based on my gender</em>.

      "That's not true!" I thought indignantly. I hadn't realized at the time that this discussion wasn't about me. It's wasn't their fault that I felt this way. Nobody <em>actually</em> meant to say that absolutely every man does these things. I had no idea what it was like to experience the oppression that women were dealing with. But at the time, there seemed to be hypocrisy which made me hesitant to get involved. I felt a division – that I didn't belong in the conversation at all. It seemed like an issue for women to deal with.

      This is not the case. <strong>Feminism isn't about <em>men vs. women.</em></strong> It's about chauvinists vs. feminists. What they really mean to say is "<strong>sexist</strong> men act like public spaces belong to them," not just "men." I think this distinction has a dramatic impact on how it's perceived. I don't feel as if I'm <em>on another team</em>, or something. It allows me to distance myself from the perpetrator, rather than being lumped in with him.

      The not-all-men phenomenon made me realize that many other men felt a sense of alienation, like I did. My hope is that the discussion of feminist issues can be made more amenable to support from men. I realize that I most likely don't know what's best in regards to discussing feminism. As a male, my role should involve a lot more listening than lecturing. But I do think I have valid insight on how to educate <em>other men</em>. Most of all, I wanted to write this to help cultivate a culture of acceptance and spread awareness. As men, we should by identifying instances of sexism, calling out the perpetrators, and promoting equality.
