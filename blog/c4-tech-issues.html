      There remain alarming gaps in the representation of some groups in the tech industry, reports <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/24/tech-companies-diversity-problems-are-even-worse-at-the-leadership-level/">The Washington Post</a>. Data from big tech companies like Twitter, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn show that the fastest growing industries are not growing multi-ethnic in proportion the the demography of the U.S. population. Google, for example, employs over 50,000 people, of which only 2% are black and 3% Hispanic. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy in the percentage of women in tech jobs. At companies such as Twitter, 10% of the tech jobs are held by women. <strong>What can be done about this?</strong>

      One factor is perhaps a lack of interest in tech fields among these groups due to preconceived ideas about what they "should be" interested in. I think that if children are more encouraged to pursue these carriers, it would cultivate interest and help offset the socioeconomic obstacles that these groups face. There are many non-profit organizations that hold outreach programs with this precise goal in mind. One of which is <a href="http://www.steamnation.org/">S.T.E.A.M. Nation</a>. They give demonstrations of science and tech innovations and principles to children in order to inspire and educate.

      There is a similar problem in chemistry. When I was in graduate school, I volunteered at some outreach events to try to generate interest in science among underrepresented groups. I can say with absolute conviction that it makes a difference. I would encourage my colleagues and cohort-mates to contribute to endeavors like these when they arise. I think if tech companies sponsored more events like this, we'd see the right kind of growth in tech fields!
