      My experience in DBC so far this week has been really positive. DBC is about hardwork, teamwork and push one's limit intellectually. We are good at what we are passionate about. And if I am passionate about learning to be the best developer, I feel that I would do great at DBC.

    <p>
       I see myself fit well with the teamwork and collaboration culture at DBC.The learning environment at DBC is about taking responsibility and learn how to take control one's own learning experience. There is no one here to hold your hand but at the same time, there is a lot of resources for me to take advantage of.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am excited to participate in the DBC learning experience over the course of next 20 or so weeks. I hope by the end of this journey, I will have accomplished all that I hope to accomplish.
