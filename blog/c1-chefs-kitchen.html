    <h2>Kitchen vs. Table Mindset</h2>
    <h3>Fireside Chat with Shereef</h3>

      Dev Bootcamp takes an abrupt departure from the pedagogical styles of more traditional teaching facilities. The University of California, for example, an institution that enriched and edified me for five years, has been around since 1868. It has well established, tried-and-true methods. These highly proven methods attract the attention of prospective students worldwide. They pay a fee to open a path, paved long ago, to a brighter future. This is the table/restaurant mindset. There is a bespoke set of benefits that is served in exchange for for a price, i.e. tuition. DBC is different. It's been around for a few years and the curriculum changes constantly. It is largely, in <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's words</a> , "a big experiment." The assets that we get out of the program are a function of the effort and fervor we put into it. This is the kitchen mindset. We are not here to "order an education" and pay a tab, but to work together to bring it to fruition! DBC is made whole by the passion of its students.

      I am not without trepidation. I may get frustrated. I may have to reckon with failure and inadequacy. I know that upon graduation, the "dream job" is not guaranteed. I may even be entirely consumed under the whelm of trying to become a competent programmer in less than a year!

      But this is the beauty of DBC. It has the audacity to challenge the status quo. It dares to improve upon the acceptable. When I decided to quit chemistry, none of my friends and family were very encouraging. Everyone insisted that I was making a mistake. But finding your true passion is never a mistake. Despite the risks, I believe I have the tenacity to become a greater developer. I will make this bootcamp work to my absolute advantage. I will walk in those doors with the resolution to prove to everyone that I have what it takes. <strong>I was trained as a scientist after all, so I'm not afraid of an experiment.</strong>
