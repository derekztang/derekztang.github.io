  typeof vs class

   To determine what type of value something is (a number, a fixnum, a string, an Object, an array, etc), in JavaScript you write typeof and then then the object; in Ruby, you append .class to the end of the object.

   In JavaScript, the triple equals sign helps determine if two objects are the same exact object (having the same typeof and the same value). For example: 3 === 3 returns true In Ruby, that is accomplished through the double equals. (3 == 3 returns true)

   JavaScript has its own double equals, which shouldn’t be confused with Ruby’s: double equals in JavaScript only determines if the values match. For example: "3" == 3 returns true

Objects

Objects (similar to Ruby’s hash), declared as variables, are a way of organizing key/value pairs. For example, var cat = {color: "grey", name: "Spot", age: "12"}; To access the value of an associated key, you can call that on the variable name: cat.name returns "Spot". You can also easily delete a key/value pair by writing delete cat.name. To declare a new key/value pair, write: cat.gender = "male";. This appends this new data point to the end of the Object.
