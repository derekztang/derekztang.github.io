    <h2>Chemophobia</h2>
    <h3>The Irrational Fear of Chemicals</h3>
    <h4><em>Feb 19, 2015</em></h4>
    <p>
      We live in an age with an abundance of information about what's in our food. Metrics like metabolic energy (Calories), ingredients, and portions of fat, carbs, and protein are fully disclosed on most food products. We're empowered to make remarkably informed decisions about our diets. However, have we become paranoid under the whelm of all this information? What effects could this be having on our perception of chemistry?
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of us recall the outrage over Subway's use of azodicarbonamide in their bread, more commonly referred to as <strong>the yoga mat chemical</strong> due to it's use in the production of yoga mats. Azodicarbonamide was used because it improves the texture and color of the bread. It does so via thermolytic breakdown during the baking process. At the amounts used in bread, it is safe and approved by the FDA. The chemical is erroneously feared because <a href="http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad16.pdf">studies have shown</a> that directly inhaling it in <em>much</em> greater amounts can induce asthma. Furthermore one of the breakdown products, urethane, is a known carcinogen â€“ again, only in greater amounts. Despite it's benign nature, Subway removed the ingredient to quell the outrage.

      Many of you are likely thinking, "I don't want <strong>any</strong> amount of harmful chemicals in my body!" It's not unreasonable to feel that way. However, "harmful chemicals" likely describes more substances than you think it does. Please bear with me for a bit. Consider the chemical <strong>dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO).</strong> As an M.S. in chemistry, I can assure you that every statement on this website (<a href="http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html">http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html</a>) is true. The perils of DHMO include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.</li>
      <li>Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.</li>
      <li>Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.</li>
      <li>DHMO is a major component of acid rain.</li>
      <li>Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.</li>
      <li>Contributes to soil erosion.</li>
      <li>Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.</li>
      <li>Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.</li>
      <li>Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.</li>
      <li>Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.</li>
      <li>Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.</li>
      <li>And others...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>This</strong>, ladies and gentleman, is in nearly every food you eat. Why? DHMO is water. It's just another name for it. But by using this name along with these technically true facts, a student was able to convince a bunch of adults to sign a petition to <em>ban the stuff</em>. We shouldn't ban water, even though it can kill you. Yes, water can kill you in many ways. Breathing too much of it will drown you. Even drinking too much can induce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</a> and kill you. Water is therefore a dangerous chemical. Or is it? Well it <em>can be</em> in certain amounts. The point is that the amount matters immensely. Fretting over the effects of large doses of azodicarbonamide via inhalation is silly. There is MUCH less azodicarbonamide in bread, far under the threshold to make it dangerous.
    </p>

      Okay, so the azodicarbonamide in Subway bread is gone. Who cares? Most of us would've never even noticed it was gone. Well, more dire consequences have transpired because of chemophobia. One of the worst is the removal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal">thiomersal</a> from vaccines. Formerly used as a preservative, it is feared for its mercury atom within the chemical structure. Mercury metal is a potent environmental toxin. However, that certainly doesn't mean every molecule with a mercury atom is dangerous. After all, sodium metal explodes when it touches water! But... sodium chloride is *dramatic pause* table salt. Nevertheless, it was phased out of use.

      After removal due to safety concerns, vaccines became more expensive. There lacked a suitable, cheap alternative. Without a preservative, the shipping and storage of vaccines became more complicated. They also had a shorter shelf life. The effects weren't felt here in the United States. But the accessibility of vaccines decreased in impoverished, third world countries. The plight of fighting disease stumbled because of chemophobia.

      Frequently I see articles like <a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/a10284/foods-you-should-never-eat/?src=spr_FBPAGE">these</a> scattered about my Facebook feed. They tell people to avoid anything that has a scary chemical name, mention the negative effects of consuming the chemical in vast excess, and perpetuate this unfounded fear of chemicals. Little do they know that the "avoid things you can't ID" mantra predicates against consuming DHMO (water). This is the very bias that the DHMO hoax aims to expose. Yet I see my peers falling victim to this fear. My hope is that people will consider these things when analyzing what they read online. People often exalt things that are "chemical-free" and it's patently absurd (and incorrect, since everything on earth is a chemical). So the next time someone tells you an approved chemical should be avoided at all cost, tell them about to horrors of DHMO!
