  <h2>Ruby: Enumerable#map</h2>

      Hashes and arrays are great tools for organizing our data, but what's far more powerful is the ability to manipulate that data. This can of course be done with the #each method, but Ruby also includes a module called Enumerable that contains a wide variety of other useful methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      One widely used method is the #map method. #map returns a new array that contains the result of running the block once for every element.
    </p>
    <p>
      [1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * n } #=> [1, 4, 9]
    </p>
    <p>
      This differs from #each in that it allows us to create a new array as opposed to simply doing something with the data contained in the original array.
