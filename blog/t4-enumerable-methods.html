    <h2>Enumerable Methods</h2>
    <h3>The Power of Container Objects</h3>
    <h4><em>Feb 22, 2015</em></h4>
    <p>
      The <code>Enumerable</code> module is one of the hallmarks of Ruby. It's an assortment of methods for container objects, like arrays and hashes which I talked about in my <a ui-sref="t3-arrays-hashes">previous blog post</a>. These methods streamline the process of performing operations on each of the elements within a container object. The crux of <code>Enumerable</code> is that its inclusion into a class requires an <code>#each</code> method for that class, because enumerable methods call <code>#each</code>. Think of <code>#each</code> as a set of instructions for how to iterate over an object. Once that is set, you can set in motion the pre-existing machinery for enumerable objects! For example the <code>Array#each</code> method looks something like this:

      Arrays have a very intuitive progression. Each element in the array gets yielded to a code block in order from 0, 1, 2, until the end. In the example above, <code>#each</code> is called to <code>puts</code> each integer in the array incremented by one. One of the most useful <code>Enumerable</code> methods is <code>#map</code>. This stores each output in a new array.

      The advantage here is that the array can be saved to a variable and manipulated, instead of just being <code>puts</code>ed. Again, <code>#map</code> calls <code>#each</code>. The same is true for other <code>Enumerable</code> methods like <code>#cycle</code>, <code>#select</code>, or <code>#group_by</code>. The beauty of these methods is that they exist for all other container object classes, like <code>Range</code> and <code>Set</code>, although they don't all work exactly the same way. They can even be applied to classes of your own creation, as long as you define an <code>#each</code> method!
