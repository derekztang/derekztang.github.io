    <h2>Completions</h2>
    <h3>Workflow Part I</h3>

      It's said that soul mates can finish each other's sentences. If that's the case, Sublime Text 2 is the closest thing I have to a soul mate at the moment. Hey, I'm just talking about completions here! Nothing weird. What do I mean by completions? When you begin typing things into your code editor, it may summon a menu of suggestions based on what you've typed so far. These are completions. For example, if you use Sublime to make HTML docs, you probably don't type out all 11 keystrokes to make your <code>div</code> tags. Simply by typing <code>&ltd</code> can you get the open and closing tags for a <code>div</code>!

      This is great! Of course it also recognizes other tags, not just <code>div</code>s. Every time you type a tag, a second or two is saved. By a back-of-the-envelope calculation, on the timescale of a month this can amount to <strong>several hours saved!</strong> Although Sublime comes with several useful completions, it doesn't know everything. For example, it doesn't know jQuery methods. Luckily, there are libraries of completions available online! I highly recommend this one, <a href="https://github.com/Pleasurazy/Sublime-Better-Completion">Pleasurazy</a> (I think it's a contraction of "pleasure" and "lazy"). It knows jQuery, JS DOM manipulation methods, Twitter Bootstrap classes, and many more. Check it out!

      You'll never have to type out <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> again! You'll also notice that it utilizes fuzzy searching, meaning the matching characters don't have to be consecutive. What's particularly valuable about these is the learning potential. When I was learning Bootstrap, I wanted to add a <code>panel</code> class. Among the options were classes like <code>panel-primary</code> and <code>panel-danger</code>, which I had forgotten about. The completions remind you of options you didn't even know you had!

      Completions are an excellent workflow tool. Not only do they save time, they also expedite the learning process. In my next post, I'll talk about a similar concept: snippets.
